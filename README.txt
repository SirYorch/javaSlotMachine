App created for being used as a SlotMachine, it works by pressing the button iniciar Todos, or pressing the independent Iniciar button in every line, the speed can be changed by setting a nnumber between 1-15 in the Text Fields for every line, or in the Test Field to the left of Iniciar Todos so every line will work with the same speed. Parar and Parar Todos buttons will stop the slot movement with an animation, and the app will verify if the image is the same, so it will give a win o loose message when it stops.
